Web Audio API Sequencer
=======================

This little ditty arose from an exploration of the Web Audio API.
The sequencer moves from left to right.
It plays a sound when it passes a checked checkbox.

Installation
------------

Nothing fancy going on here,
just straight-up HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Clone the project and serve the sequence directory.
Folks using OS X can use the built-in python web server.
`cd` to the sequence folder and run this:

      python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Acknowledgements
----------------

This project uses Jquery, Backbone, Underscore, and Audia. Thanks ya'll.

The sounds samples come from various Super Mario.
We didn't make 'em and we don't claim to own 'em.
They belong to Nintendo. Nintendo, keep making cool games.
